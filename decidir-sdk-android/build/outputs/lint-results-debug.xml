        explanation="This check scans through libraries looking for calls to APIs that are not included in Android.

When you create Android projects, the classpath is set up such that you can only access classes in the API packages that are included in Android. However, if you add other projects to your libs/ folder, there is no guarantee that those .jar files were built with an Android specific classpath, and in particular, they could be accessing unsupported APIs such as java.applet.

This check scans through library jars and looks for references to API packages that are not included in Android and flags these. This is only an error if your code calls one of the library classes which wind up referencing the unsupported package.">

        id="OldTargetApi"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details."
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Target SDK attribute is not targeting latest version"
        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version you are adding support for: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html"

        id="SimpleDateFormat"
        severity="Warning"
        message="To get local formatting use `getDateInstance()`, `getDateTimeInstance()`, or `getTimeInstance()`, or use `new SimpleDateFormat(String template, Locale locale)` with for example `Locale.US` for ASCII dates."
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Implied locale in date format"
        explanation="Almost all callers should use `getDateInstance()`, `getDateTimeInstance()`, or `getTimeInstance()` to get a ready-made instance of SimpleDateFormat suitable for the user&apos;s locale. The main reason you&apos;d create an instance this class directly is because you need to format/parse a specific machine-readable format, in which case you almost certainly want to explicitly ask for US to ensure that you get ASCII digits (rather than, say, Arabic digits).

Therefore, you should either use the form of the SimpleDateFormat constructor where you pass in an explicit locale, such as Locale.US, or use one of the get instance methods, or suppress this error if really know what you are doing."

        summary="Incorrect order of elements in manifest"
        explanation="The &lt;application> tag should appear after the elements which declare which version you need, which features you need, which libraries you need, and so on. In the past there have been subtle bugs (such as themes not getting applied correctly) when the `&lt;application>` tag appears before some of these other elements, so it&apos;s best to order your manifest in the logical dependency order."
